# Comprehensive Fundamental Analysis Framework

## Current Status

### **What We Currently Use:**

**ðŸ”´ VALUE Strategy**: 
- **Attempted**: PE ratio, PB ratio, PS ratio, dividend yield, ROE
- **Problem**: These columns don't exist in our fundamentals table
- **Actually Using**: Nothing (failed due to missing columns)

**ðŸŸ¡ GROWTH Strategy**:
- **Attempted**: Revenue growth, earnings growth  
- **Problem**: Limited growth calculation capability
- **Actually Using**: Basic revenue/earnings growth when available

**ðŸŸ¢ MOMENTUM Strategy**:
- **Using**: Price-based momentum only (3mo, 6mo, 1yr returns)
- **Status**: Working correctly (no fundamentals needed)

**ðŸ”´ DIVIDEND Strategy**:
- **Attempted**: Dividend yield, growth rates
- **Problem**: Limited dividend data integration
- **Actually Using**: Basic dividend payout when available

## What We Have vs What We Need

### **Current Fundamentals (Available)**:
```sql
-- Basic Financials
totalrevenue          -- Revenue  
grossprofit          -- Gross Profit
netincome            -- Net Income
eps                  -- Earnings Per Share
totalassets          -- Total Assets
totalliabilities     -- Total Liabilities  
totalshareholderequity -- Shareholders' Equity
operatingcashflow    -- Operating Cash Flow
capitalexpenditures  -- CapEx
dividendpayout       -- Dividend Payout
free_cf              -- Free Cash Flow
cash_flow_per_share  -- CF Per Share
```

### **Missing Critical Ratios** (Need to Calculate):
```sql
-- Valuation Ratios  
pe_ratio = market_cap / netincome
pb_ratio = market_cap / totalshareholderequity  
ps_ratio = market_cap / totalrevenue
ev_ebitda_ratio = enterprise_value / ebitda

-- Profitability Ratios
roe = netincome / totalshareholderequity
roa = netincome / totalassets  
gross_margin = grossprofit / totalrevenue
net_margin = netincome / totalrevenue
operating_margin = operating_income / totalrevenue

-- Financial Health
debt_to_equity = totalliabilities / totalshareholderequity
current_ratio = current_assets / current_liabilities
quick_ratio = (current_assets - inventory) / current_liabilities  
interest_coverage = ebit / interest_expense

-- Growth Metrics
revenue_growth_1yr = (revenue_current / revenue_prev) - 1
earnings_growth_1yr = (earnings_current / earnings_prev) - 1
eps_growth_1yr = (eps_current / eps_prev) - 1

-- Dividend Metrics  
dividend_yield = annual_dividend / stock_price
payout_ratio = dividends / netincome
dividend_coverage = free_cash_flow / dividends
```

## Strategy-Specific Fundamental Requirements

### **ðŸ”µ VALUE Strategy - "Buy Cheap, Quality Companies"**

**Primary Metrics (Must Have)**:
- **PE Ratio** < 15 (cheaper is better)
- **PB Ratio** < 2.0 (asset value)  
- **PS Ratio** < 1.5 (sales value)
- **ROE** > 15% (profitability quality)
- **Debt/Equity** < 0.5 (financial stability)

**Secondary Metrics (Nice to Have)**:
- **Free Cash Flow Yield** > 5%
- **Dividend Yield** > 2%  
- **Current Ratio** > 1.5
- **Interest Coverage** > 5x
- **Net Margin** > 5%

**Value Score Formula**:
```python
value_score = (
    (1/pe_ratio * 20) +           # Inverse PE (lower is better)
    (1/pb_ratio * 15) +           # Inverse PB  
    (1/ps_ratio * 10) +           # Inverse PS
    (roe * 0.5) +                 # ROE bonus
    (dividend_yield * 10) +       # Dividend bonus
    (current_ratio * 5) -         # Liquidity bonus
    (debt_to_equity * 20)         # Debt penalty
)
```

- **PEG Ratio** < 1.5 (growth at reasonable price)

**Growth Score Formula**:
```python  
growth_score = (
    (revenue_growth_1yr * 25) +        # Revenue growth bonus
    (earnings_growth_1yr * 30) +       # Earnings growth bonus  
    (eps_growth_1yr * 20) +            # EPS growth bonus
    (roe * 0.3) +                      # Profitability quality
    (gross_margin * 15) +              # Margin quality
    (fcf_growth * 10)                  # Cash generation growth
)
```

### **ðŸŸ  MOMENTUM Strategy - "Buy What's Moving Up"**

**Primary Metrics (Current - Price Only)**:
- **3-Month Return** (40% weight)  
- **6-Month Return** (35% weight)
- **1-Year Return** (25% weight)

**Enhanced Metrics (Add Fundamental Momentum)**:
- **Earnings Surprise** (last 4 quarters)
- **Revenue Surprise** (last 4 quarters)  
- **Analyst Upgrades** vs Downgrades

    # Price Momentum (70%)
    (return_3mo * 0.28) +
    (return_6mo * 0.24) +  
    (return_1yr * 0.18) +
    
    # Fundamental Momentum (30%)
    (earnings_surprise_avg * 0.10) +

    (dividend_growth_3yr * 20) +      # Growth sustainability  
    ((1 - payout_ratio) * 30) +       # Safety (lower payout)
    (fcf_coverage * 10) +             # Cash flow safety
    (dividend_years * 0.5) +          # History bonus

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Calculate Missing Ratios**
```sql
-- Add computed columns or create views
CREATE VIEW enhanced_fundamentals AS
SELECT 
    f.*,
    -- Valuation ratios (need market cap from price data)
    (p.market_cap / NULLIF(f.netincome, 0)) as pe_ratio,
    (p.market_cap / NULLIF(f.totalshareholderequity, 0)) as pb_ratio,
    (p.market_cap / NULLIF(f.totalrevenue, 0)) as ps_ratio,
    
    -- Profitability ratios  
    (f.netincome / NULLIF(f.totalshareholderequity, 0)) as roe,
    (f.netincome / NULLIF(f.totalassets, 0)) as roa,
    (f.grossprofit / NULLIF(f.totalrevenue, 0)) as gross_margin,
    (f.netincome / NULLIF(f.totalrevenue, 0)) as net_margin,
    
    -- Financial health
    (f.totalliabilities / NULLIF(f.totalshareholderequity, 0)) as debt_to_equity
    
FROM fundamentals_annual f
JOIN market_data p ON f.symbol = p.symbol AND f.fiscal_date = p.date
```

### **Phase 2: Growth Calculations**  
```sql
-- Calculate year-over-year growth rates
WITH growth_calcs AS (
    SELECT 
        symbol,
        fiscal_date,
        totalrevenue,
        netincome,
        eps,
        LAG(totalrevenue, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY fiscal_date) as prev_revenue,
        LAG(netincome, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY fiscal_date) as prev_earnings,
        LAG(eps, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY fiscal_date) as prev_eps
    FROM fundamentals_annual
)
SELECT 
    *,
    (totalrevenue / NULLIF(prev_revenue, 0) - 1) as revenue_growth_1yr,
    (netincome / NULLIF(prev_earnings, 0) - 1) as earnings_growth_1yr,  
    (eps / NULLIF(prev_eps, 0) - 1) as eps_growth_1yr
FROM growth_calcs
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Strategy Models**
- Update each strategy to use comprehensive fundamentals
- Add quality filters and risk controls
- Implement proper sector-relative scoring
- Add fundamental momentum indicators

Would you like me to implement this comprehensive framework? We can start with Phase 1 (calculating the missing ratios) and then build the enhanced strategy models.
