- `tests/` folder (old ranking tests)
- Unused utils (5 files removed, kept only logging_config.py)
- Old pipeline scripts (4 removed)

### 3. Files Fixed/Updated

  - Fixed column mappings (trade_date, open, close, etc.)

- **data_fetch/__init__.py**
  - Removed import of deleted fetch_manager

### 4. Current Status

#### Database: ✅ CLEAN
```
15 Essential Tables:
- Core Data: symbol_universe, stock_prices, sp500_history, forward_returns
- Fundamentals: fundamentals, company_fundamentals_overview, dividend_history
- Strategy: excess_cash_flow_metrics, dividend_sustainability_metrics, breakout_signals, sp500_outperformance_detail  
- Portfolio: portfolio_scores, portfolio_holdings, portfolio_rebalances, portfolio_performance
```

#### Data Population Progress:
- ✅ Symbol Universe: 1,973 quality stocks loaded ($2B+ market cap)
- ✅ S&P 500 History: 6,496 records (1999-2025)
- ✅ Stock Prices: 49,026 records loaded (testing with 10 symbols)
- ⏳ Company Overview: In progress (takes ~3-4 minutes for all symbols)
- ⏳ Fundamentals: Not yet started
- ⏳ Dividends: Not yet started

## Next Steps

### To Complete First-Time Setup:
```bash
# 1. Fetch all stock prices (will take ~1-2 hours for 1,973 symbols)
python data_fetch/market_data/fetch_prices.py

# 2. Fetch company overviews (for market cap, sector, industry)
python data_fetch/fundamentals/fetch_company_overview.py

# 3. Fetch fundamentals (financial statements)
python data_fetch/fundamentals/fetch_fundamentals.py

# 4. Fetch dividend history
python data_fetch/fundamentals/fetch_dividend_history.py

# 5. Calculate portfolio scores
python strategies/calculate_portfolio_scores.py
```

### Daily Operations (after setup):
```bash
# Run daily pipeline
python pipelines/run_daily_pipeline_v2.py
```

### Weekly Operations:
```bash
# Run weekly pipeline (includes fundamentals update)
python pipelines/run_weekly_pipeline.py
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Simplified Architecture** - Removed complex ML and ranking systems
2. **Cleaner Database** - Only essential tables for three-portfolio strategy
3. **Quality Focus** - Only mid/large cap stocks ($2B+)
4. **Faster Execution** - No more 19-script ranking process
5. **Clear Strategy** - VALUE, GROWTH, DIVIDEND portfolios based on excess cash flow

## Important Notes
- All scripts now use centralized utilities (logging, database, rate limiting)
- Alpha Vantage API limited to 600 calls/min (premium tier)
- Database schema managed in `database/setup_schema_clean.py`
- First full data fetch will take 3-4 hours due to API rate limits
