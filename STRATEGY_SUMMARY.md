# ACIS Three-Portfolio Strategy Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive investment strategy that generates three distinct portfolios (Value, Growth, Dividend) based on the ACIS five-pillar investment philosophy.

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Investment Philosophy (5 Pillars)
- **Excess Cash Flow** - Primary metric for company quality
- **Fundamental Trends** - 10y/5y/current trend analysis
- **Value Investing** - Historical valuation extremes
- **Growth Investing** - Long-term S&P 500 outperformance
- **Dividend Sustainability** - Payment history and growth

### 2. Core Analysis Modules
- `analysis/excess_cash_flow.py` - Calculates the most important metric
- `analysis/dividend_sustainability.py` - Comprehensive dividend analysis
- `portfolios/portfolio_manager.py` - Three-portfolio selection and rebalancing

### 3. Database Architecture

#### New Tables Created:
- `excess_cash_flow_metrics` - Core quality metric
- `dividend_sustainability_metrics` - Dividend analysis
- `portfolio_scores` - Three scores for every stock
- `portfolio_holdings` - Current portfolio positions
- `portfolio_rebalances` - Rebalancing history
- `portfolio_performance` - Performance tracking

#### Tables We Can Remove/Consolidate:
Based on our focused strategy, we can simplify by removing:

1. **ml_predictions** - Not needed for rule-based portfolios
2. **ml_models** - Not using ML for portfolio selection
3. **ml_features** - Superseded by portfolio_scores
4. **backtest_results** - Can use portfolio_performance instead
5. **trading_signals** - Portfolio holdings serve this purpose

### 4. Three Portfolios

#### VALUE PORTFOLIO (Quarterly Rebalance)
- **Objective**: Buy quality companies at extreme discounts
- **Size**: Top 10 stocks
- **Scoring**: 35% valuation, 30% excess CF, 20% fundamentals, 15% margin of safety
- **Requirements**: 
  - Bottom quintile historical valuation
  - Excess cash flow >20%
  - Stable/advancing fundamentals

#### GROWTH PORTFOLIO (Quarterly Rebalance)
- **Objective**: Own long-term compounders
- **Size**: Top 10 stocks
- **Scoring**: 35% S&P alpha, 30% CF growth, 20% revenue growth, 15% ROIC
- **Requirements**:
  - 10+ year outperformance
  - Excess cash flow >40%
  - Revenue growth >10% annually

#### DIVIDEND PORTFOLIO (Annual Rebalance)
- **Objective**: Growing income from quality payers
- **Size**: Top 10 stocks
- **Scoring**: 30% sustainability, 25% excess CF, 25% growth, 20% history
- **Requirements**:
  - 10+ years dividend history
  - Payout ratio <60% FCF
  - Excess cash flow >30%
  - Quality score >60

### 5. Portfolio Rules

#### Diversification:
- Max 30% in any sector
- Max 2 stocks per industry
- $2B+ market cap only
- US common stocks only

#### Position Management:
- Equal weight (10% each) at rebalance
- Let winners run between rebalances
- Max 20% position through appreciation
- Quality-based stops, not price-based

## ðŸ“Š Scoring System

Each stock receives three distinct scores (0-100):

### Value Score Components:
- Historical valuation percentile (40%)
- Excess cash flow yield (30%)
- Margin of safety (30%)

### Growth Score Components:
- 10-year S&P 500 alpha (35%)
- 5-year fundamental growth (35%)
- Forward indicators (30%)

### Dividend Score Components:
- Sustainability metrics (40%)
- Growth consistency (30%)
- Payment history (30%)

## ðŸ”„ Rebalancing Schedule

| Portfolio | Frequency | Next Rebalance | Trigger |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| VALUE | Quarterly | End of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 | Scheduled |
| GROWTH | Quarterly | End of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 | Scheduled |
| DIVIDEND | Annual | End of Year | Scheduled |

**Forced Rebalance Triggers:**
- Quality score drops >50%
- Fundamental thesis breaks
- Market correction >10% (opportunistic)

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

### Value Portfolio:
- Higher returns during market recoveries
- Lower volatility than growth
- Margin of safety protection

### Growth Portfolio:
- Highest long-term returns
- Higher volatility acceptable
- Compound wealth over decades

### Dividend Portfolio:
- Steady income growth
- Lower volatility
- Inflation protection

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Run data fetching to populate fundamentals
2. Calculate all portfolio scores
3. Generate initial portfolios
4. Set up automated rebalancing

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add tax-loss harvesting logic
2. Implement position sizing optimization
3. Create performance attribution analysis
4. Build portfolio visualization dashboard
5. Add risk parity weighting option

## ðŸ’» Key Commands

```bash
# Calculate excess cash flow for all stocks
python analysis/excess_cash_flow.py

# Analyze dividend sustainability
python analysis/dividend_sustainability.py

# Run portfolio selection and rebalancing
python portfolios/portfolio_manager.py

# Update all portfolio scores
python portfolios/portfolio_manager.py --update-scores

# Rebalance specific portfolio
python portfolios/portfolio_manager.py --rebalance VALUE
python portfolios/portfolio_manager.py --rebalance GROWTH
python portfolios/portfolio_manager.py --rebalance DIVIDEND
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Queries

```sql
-- View current VALUE portfolio
SELECT * FROM portfolio_holdings 
WHERE portfolio_type = 'VALUE' AND is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY selection_rank;

-- Check portfolio performance
SELECT * FROM portfolio_performance
WHERE portfolio_type = 'GROWTH'
ORDER BY measurement_date DESC;

-- See latest rebalance changes
SELECT * FROM portfolio_rebalances
ORDER BY rebalance_date DESC;

-- Top scoring stocks across all portfolios
SELECT symbol, value_score, growth_score, dividend_score
FROM portfolio_scores
WHERE calculation_date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY (value_score + growth_score + dividend_score) DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## âœ… Strategy Alignment

Our implementation perfectly aligns with your investment philosophy:

1. **Excess Cash Flow is Primary** - Every portfolio requires positive excess CF
2. **Long-term Focus** - 10-20 year performance metrics
3. **Quality Over Price** - Fundamentals must be stable/advancing
4. **Sustainable Dividends** - Comprehensive sustainability scoring
5. **Systematic Approach** - Rule-based, no emotional decisions

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

Track portfolio success with:
- Annual returns vs S&P 500
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
- Maximum drawdown
- Dividend growth rate
- Quality score trends

This comprehensive system implements your complete investment strategy with automated portfolio management, ensuring disciplined execution of your value, growth, and dividend investment approaches.
