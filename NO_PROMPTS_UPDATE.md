# Removed All Y/N Prompts - Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated run_first_time.py
- **Removed**: All `input()` prompts asking for Y/N confirmation
- **Changed**: Script now runs automatically from start to finish
- **Behavior**: If a step fails, it logs the error and continues with next step

### 2. Verified All Scripts
- ✅ **fetch_quality_stocks.py** - No prompts found
- ✅ **fetch_company_overview.py** - No prompts found  
- ✅ **fetch_fundamentals.py** - No prompts found
- ✅ **fetch_prices.py** - No prompts found
- ✅ **All other Python scripts** - No input() prompts found

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Execution
```bash
# Just run this - no prompts, no interruptions
python run_first_time.py
```

The script will:
1. Setup database (15 tables)
2. Fetch stock universe (~2,000 stocks)
3. Download S&P 500 history
4. Fetch all price data (2-3 hours)
5. Fetch fundamentals (2-3 hours)
6. Calculate portfolio scores
7. Complete without user interaction

### Error Handling
- If any step fails, it logs the error and continues
- No more "Continue anyway? (y/n)" prompts
- Script runs to completion regardless of individual failures

## Benefits
- **Fully Automated** - Can run unattended
- **CI/CD Ready** - No interactive prompts blocking automation
- **Scheduled Runs** - Can be added to cron/scheduler
- **Remote Execution** - Can run via SSH without TTY

## Running Daily/Weekly Pipelines
These also run without prompts:
```bash
# Daily update (no prompts)
python pipelines/run_daily_pipeline_v2.py

# Weekly update (no prompts)  
python pipelines/run_weekly_pipeline.py
```

## Note
The entire ACIS platform is now prompt-free and ready for automated operations.
